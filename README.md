# liri-bot

LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. This particular instance of the program was developed by Cezar Carvalhaes in 2018.

LIRI takes the following commands:

my-tweets: Gives back you back the last 20 tweets for eclectic bromestic.

spotify-this-song + [your-song]: Provides information about the requested song title from spotify

movie-this + [movie]: Provides information about the requested movie from the Open Movie Database

do-what-it-says: pulls information from a random.txt file to provide one of the above commands.

Keys for the twitter and spotify APIs are protecting using the dotenv node package.
